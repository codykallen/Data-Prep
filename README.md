# Data-Prep
Code for cleaning and preparing microdata

# Overview
This repo is intended to hold code for cleaning and preparing microdata. Future work may attempt to combine several of these, either through matching or regression imputation.

A useful resource is Olivetti, Silverman, Hong and Wiczer (2012), available at http://www.econ.nyu.edu/user/violante/NYUTeaching/QM/Spring15/Documents/datadoc_vr0j.pdf.
